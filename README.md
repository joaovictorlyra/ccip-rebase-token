# Cross Chain Rebase Token

1. A protocol tha allows users to deposit into a vult and in return, receive rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance
2. Rebase Token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show the changing balance with time
    - Balance increases linearly with time
    - Mint tokens to our users every time they perform an auction (minting, burning, transferring, or bridging)
3. Interest rate
    - Individually set an interest rate for each user based on a global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault
    - This global interest rate can only decrease to incentivise/reward early adopters
    - Increase token adoption
